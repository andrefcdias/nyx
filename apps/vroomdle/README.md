# Vroomdle

## What is it?

Vroomdle is an app inspired by [Framed](https://framed.wtf/), and by consequence [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html), about guessing motor racing related stuff.

## What's it built on?

Here's what I used to build Vroomdle:
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [SolidJS](https://solidjs.com)
- [Vanilla Extract](https://github.com/seek-oss/vanilla-extract#globalstyle)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm dev` or `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles Solid in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

## Deployment

You can deploy the `dist` folder to any static host provider (netlify, surge, now, etc.)
